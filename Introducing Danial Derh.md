## _Hello!_ 
My name is **_Danial Derh_**, and I come from a place called **Scarborough,** which is located in **Toronto**. I lived in Scarborough for about 8 years with my parents, brother, and sister, until I moved to a city called **Markham**. Markham is around _25 minutes_ from Scarborough, so it wasn't _too big_ of a change for me. I still got the chance to visit old friends, and I wasn't too far from my family. **Until, 4 years later, I moved to...**  
## _Ottawa!_
Moving to **Ottawa** was a _huge_ change for me. Not only was I _450 kilometers_ away from my hometown, siblings, and friends, but I knew no one in my school. I would have to make friends all over again, and that thought **terrified** me, because of how _socially awkward_ I am. Regardless, I started attending **Glen Cairn Middle School** on _May 4, 2016_. GC was a much different school compared to my old one. For example, it was a grade 7 - 8 middle school, and not a JK - grade 8 public school. The people were _different_, their hobbies were _different_, everything was _different_, but as John F. Kennedy said:  
>"Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future."  

It's been about a year since I came here and (contrary to what I thought _before_ I moved here) **I am still alive and well.** I joined a new out of school basketball team, and I have made many new friends. I have also learnt _many_ different skills in the past year, like how to make new friends.  

## _What I Do On Weekdays and Weekends_  
_Usually,_ after I come back from school and the weather is nice, I'll play basketball _till_ it gets dark. Then, I'll come home, finish my homework, and go on my computer for the rest of the day. On weekends, I'll usually wake up at 10 AM, and do whatever I want from 10 AM - 4 PM. Then, I go out to play basketball _till_ it gets dark. When it gets dark, I come home, and do whatever I want again for the rest of the day. **My weekly schedule is pretty simple** if I do say so myself.

## _Interests and Hobbies!_
I've many different interests and hobbies, but I'll list just a few here (in order of my preference):
1. **Basketball**  
I absolutely _love_ this sport. If I could have one wish granted, instead of wishing for world peace, I would wish for a basketball court inside my house.
2. **Eating**  
  a. Specfically **cookies**  
Who doesn't like eating? I would eat cookies all day if I was rich and didn't have to worry about obesity. 
3. **Sleeping**  
Pretty self-explanatory. The only part of the day where you get to escape life's problems.
4. **Reading**  
_Reading_. It's just one of those things that I can do for hours straight, and not get bored. Fun Fact: My favorite book series is Rick Riordan's: _The Heroes of Olympus_
## _A Picture That Represents Me!_
